### My F-droid Repository

This repository hosts an [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) repo for my apps. This allows you to install and update apps very easily.

### How to use
1. At first, you should [install the F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/), it's an alternative app store for Android.
2. Now you can copy the following [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohidurbappy/fdroid/main/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=9B0BB9847CC7B7D0E9EC6BA1C7A0CA8CB8C8F1A802B05EC4499190C39AA4BAAC), then add this repository to your F-Droid client:

    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohidurbappy/fdroid/main/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=9B0BB9847CC7B7D0E9EC6BA1C7A0CA8CB8C8F1A802B05EC4499190C39AA4BAAC
    ```

    Alternatively, you can also scan this QR code:

    <p align="center">
      <img height="400px" src="./fdroid/repo/index.png" alt="F-Droid repo QR code"/>
    </p>

3. Open the link in F-Droid. It will ask you to add the repository. Everything should already be filled in correctly, so just press "OK".
4. You can now install my apps, e.g. start by searching for "Notality" in the F-Droid client.
